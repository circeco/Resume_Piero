                        <p>● <strong>1-year project</strong> about the fashion industry's environmental impact focusing on cotton, <strong>Life Cycle Assessment</strong>, <strong>Planetary Boundaries</strong> and <strong>Circular Economy</strong>.
                            This was my Master's thesis and was part of a broader project called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/research-news/2017-04-04-fashion-within-boundaries.html">"Fashion Within Boundaries"</a>, with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation for circular economy and the fashion retailer H&M.
                            The focus of the overall project was to understand how applied circular economic and business strategies can reduce pressure on Planetary Boundaries throughout the reduction of resource use and emissions.
                            My focus involved tracking and measuring emissions and resource use of the textile supply chain throughout all processes from the growing of cotton, to processing, transporting, manufacturing, finishing processing, until disposal or possibly reuse or recycling.
                            I have used Life Cycle Analysis to operationalise the scientific framework of the Planetary Boundaries.
                            Hence, I have defined the system, I have collected and combined all data in <strong>GaBi </strong>(software for LCA), and then I have designed an analytical tool to measure and compare emission and resource use to Planetary Boundaries as a reference point while understanding the magnitude and type of beneficial effects of different circular strategies.</p>
